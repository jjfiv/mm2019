# smith-gitbot
A bot that must have the last word makes for a decent git tutorial.

## Instructions:

1. Get write access to this repository (need your github handle).
1. Clone this repository.
2. Make a new file that is just yours!
```bash
cp jjfoley.py $USER.py
```
3. Add and commit!
```bash
git add $USER.py
git commit -m "Made a file for myself!"
```
4. Send your changes to github. Until it is successful: (maybe pick a different filename if it's already used)!
```bash
git pull
git push
```
5. Observe ``last-word-bot`` committing the time over you.
6. Practice editing the file and dealing with the need to pull and push to get your changes into ``master``.
